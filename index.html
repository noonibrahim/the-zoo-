          Describe a time when you were the resident technical expert. What did you do to make sure everyone was able to understand you?
          Tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to get your ideas across to your team.
          Give me an example of a time when you had to explain something fairly complex to a frustrated client. How did you handle this delicate situation?
          Tell me about a successful presentation you gave and why you think it was a hit.
